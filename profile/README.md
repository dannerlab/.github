# The Danner Lab #

In the Danner Laboratory, we study the operation of the neural circuits controlling
locomotion. Specifically, we are interested in understanding the connectivity and
function of spinal circuits, how they integrate feedback from somatosensory afferents
and commands from supraspinal centers, and how their operation is changed after motor
disorders (such as spinal cord injury). We employ computational methods (neural network
and musculoskeletal modeling) and work in close collaboration with experimentalists.
These computational techniques provide us with excellent tools to investigate dynamic
interactions between the different components of the locomotor system and allow us to
incorporate a wealth of experimental findings into cohesive, integrated models that can
then be used to derive hypotheses and guide future experiments.
